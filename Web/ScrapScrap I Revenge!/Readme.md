# Task

A Revenge web service, http://91.107.176.228:4000, that allows users to scrape websites, but only offers demo accounts that check whether you can be scraped.

If you want to enjoy the service 100%, find a way to get a user account.

"[22:11:12] => Worty: Oups i forgot to check that users are allowed to get the first flag.. i will patch it and sorry for that!"
